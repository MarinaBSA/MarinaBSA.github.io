This reminds me of the first days in school where we had to introduce ourselves.  
Such a nightmare. Well, my name is Marina, I have way too many interests and one  
of them is creating stuff I can carry with me. In my opinion, there is no better  
feeling than the contemplation of your work because even with all the bugs, hey  
I did it and by every step I'm closer to where I want to be and further from who I  
was.

I built this page so I can share my journey with whoever is interested in reading  
about it and learning with me. I am not an expert nor do I strive to be one.  
All I want is to share my thoughts and things I’ve learned with you and if midway  
I can help somebody out there to fix that one bug or to see “Build succeeded”  
that will make my day.
